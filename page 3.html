    <h1> <center>The Los Angeles Lakers </center></h1>
<h2><center> Kobe Bryant Arrives!!</center></h2>
<p>During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers got 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th
  overall out of Lower Merion High School from Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles had also signed a free-agent
  Shaquille O'Neal. Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.
  "Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers", O'Neal later said. They used their pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.
  During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos for Robert Horry. O'Neal led the team to a record of 56–26, their
  best since 1990–91, although he missed 31 games due to a knee injury. O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in
  the league in blocks (2.88 bpg) in 51 games. The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 1997
  Playoffs. O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker
  since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969. In the next round, the Lakers lost four straight games to one to the Utah Jazz.

<h2><center>2001-02 Championship</center></h2>
<p>
  Los Angeles won 58 games in 2001–02. In the playoffs, they beat the Portland Trail Blazers in a four game sweep during the first round, and
  defeated the Spurs
  4–1 in the second. Next  was the rival Kings in the Western Conference Finals. The series has been called one of the greatest
  playoff matchups in the history of the NBA. The series went to game seven, and ended in the Lakers winning. In game 1, Bryant scored 30
  points as the Lakers won, 106-99. The series would then turn in favor of Sacramento, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a
  possible 3-1
  deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac
  hit the ball away from the rim in an attempt to use up some time. Instead, the ball went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who made a
  game-winning three with under 3 seconds to play. After the Kings won game 5 on a buzzer beater, the Lakers were faced with a
  must-win game 6. In one of the most controversial playoff games in history, the Lakers ended up winning by 4 points. The Lakers won game 7 in
  overtime, with the Kings missing plenty of game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping
  Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the Finals. O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player
  besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.
