    <h1> <center>The Los Angeles Lakers </center></h1>
<h2><center> Kobe Bryant Arrives!!</center></h2>
<p>During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers got 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th
  overall out of Lower Merion High School from Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles had also signed a free-agent
  Shaquille O'Neal. Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.
  "Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers", O'Neal later said. They used their pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.
  During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos for Robert Horry. O'Neal led the team to a record of 56–26, their
  best since 1990–91, although he missed 31 games due to a knee injury. O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in
  the league in blocks (2.88 bpg) in 51 games. The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 1997
  Playoffs. O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker
  since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969. In the next round, the Lakers lost four straight games to one to the Utah Jazz.
