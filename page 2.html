    <h2> More details about <b>Minneapolis</b> Lakers history </h2>
    <p>The Lakers' franchise began in 1947 when Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen(both are from Minnesota) purchased the recently disbanded Detroit Gems of
      for $15,000 from the owner Maury Winston. Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, "Land of 10,000 Lakes",
      the team made their new name the Lakers. Sid Hartman, who is a sports write helped the team hire John Kundla to be their first head
      coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.
      The Lakers had a good roster which included a forward Jim Pollard, playmaker Herm Schaefer, and center George Mikan, who became the most
      dominant player. In their first season, they had the best record which was 43–17.
      In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the BAA, and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average
      set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two. The next season,
      the team improved their record to 51–17, becoming champions once again. In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the
      Lakers had a record of 44–24 to win their second division title. During one of those games, the score was 19–18 and the Lakers were the
      losing team in that game and the Fort Wayne Pistons being the winners. This game became
      the lowest scoring game in NBA history. In the playoffs of that season, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but
      unfortunately lost to
       the Rochester Royals in the next round.

     <h2> A couple years later...</h2>
     <p>During their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers had a record of 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. 
       Louis when their plane crash-landed. Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield.
       No one was hurt. Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia
       University. During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the
       team to Los Angeles. Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season. On
       November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while
       grabbing 25 rebounds. In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs.
       They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.

Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,[41] the Lakers improved to 54–26 in 1961–62, and made the finals. In a game five
victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61, despite fouling out of the
game. The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven. Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the
final 40 seconds to tie the game, missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010
still haunted him more than 40 years later.
